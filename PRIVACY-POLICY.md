# Privacy Policy
As free and open-source software produced for the benefit of the community, the Moonlight project takes user privacy very seriously. 

This document only covers the "Moonlight UWP" or "moonlight-xbox" applications ("Moonlight UWP"), available at 
https://github.com/TheElixZammuto/moonlight-xbox and https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/moonlight-uwp/9MW1BS08ZBTH

Because the Moonlight (and Moonlight UWP) project is open-source, other third-party developers can create derivative works that do not adhere to the guidelines in this document.

## Standard Usage
The Moonlight UWP App works by connecting to another computer ("Host") running a compatible server software, like Sunshine (https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine). 

The connection to the host is done manually by the user by inserting the IP address of the Computer the User wants to connect, or by detecting automatically compatible hosts on the LAN of the User.

In any case, the user MUST for the first time confirm the connection with the host by pairing using a shared PIN on both Moonlight and the Host.

Moonlight UWP DOES NOT connect, store, process Personal Information to other servers, services, app or computers 
other than the ones the user manually inputted (in case of hosts outside the LAN) and the ones discovered on the user LAN.

This policy only covers the client side of the stack (the Moonlight UWP App). You should also check the privacy policy of the Host Software you are using and,
if you are connecting to a non-owned computer, the privacy policy of the provider. 
For example input strokes sent from Moonlight UWP to a Server are not stored by Moonlight UWP, but they can be stored by the Host for debugging/diagnostics or any other reason not covered here.

## Diagnostic Data
Windows (both on PC and on Xbox) can generate diagnostic data and send them to the Moonlight UWP developers using tools like the Microsoft Partner Center, 
if the user has provided consent for that using the settings provided by their operating system. 

Please check your OS settings, the Microsoft Store, Xbox and Windows Privacy Policy for more and updated information about how, when and what diagnostic data is processed.

## Any Questions?
